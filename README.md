Test-driven development in Go
=============================

This repository contains the entire source code for the book [Test-driven development in Go](https://leanpub.com/golang-tdd/). 

Getting your own copy
---------------------

When you clone this repository, make sure you use the `--recursive` option:

	$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/publysher/golang-tdd.git


Checking out a specific chapter
-------------------------------

The repository contains a separate branch for each chapter. For example, if you want to see the source code as it is at the end of chapter 4, just do:

	$ git checkout chapter-04

Note: if you check out chapters before chapter 4, git will complain about non-empty directories. Just ignore this, and pretend the `src/` directory does not exist.
